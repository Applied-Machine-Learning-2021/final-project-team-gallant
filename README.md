Goal-driven AI is susceptible to neglecting ethical concerns due to its blind prioritization of optimization in order to accomplish its goal with maximal performance. Our project is designed to be prior to a value-aligned agent that will be taught human values such that it will be trained to take actions that closer align with "normal" human behavior.

Our project models accomplish two tasks: 
1. Classification task where actions are classified as either normative or non-normative.
2. Sequence generation task where sequences describing the intentions of actions are produced.
